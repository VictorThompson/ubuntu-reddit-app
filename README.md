# Reddit application for Ubuntu devices

## What is this?
This is a fork of [UbuntuPhoneRedditApp](https://github.com/brambram/UbuntuPhoneRedditApp) with some improvements and changes.  Some of the new features are available from the Toolbar, which is accessible by swiping from the bottom of the device.

## Running
### On desktop
run
    qmlscene reddit.qml

#### Requirements:
* Ubuntu 12.10
* qt 5 proper (includes qtquick 2.0)
* The Ubuntu SDK

If you don't have one of these, go [here](http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/gomobile/#step-get-toolkit) to install them.

### On phone
Instructions on how to install on a Ubuntu Touch device should be coming shortly.

## Demo
The following [demo on Youtube](http://youtu.be/T7hxxYDDw78) was created by the app's original creator. Things have changed in this fork, but the basics are the same.

## Want to help?
I'm organizing a launchpad team to further development of this app. Contact me, or visit [the pending Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-reddit-app) for more information.
